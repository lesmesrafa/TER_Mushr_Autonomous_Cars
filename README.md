# TER_Mushr_Autonomous_Cars

This repository contains the code developed for the project TER2022-024 "POC_of_UcaCup" at Université Côte d'Azur. The project has been developed by  Rafael Martín Lesmes and Eduardo Freyre Gómez.

The work has been supervised by Professors Frederic Precioso and Diane Lingrand.



## Objectives
The purpose of this development project is to implement a set of algorithms that allow a vehicle to perform various tasks autonomously, including getting from one point to another as quickly as possible; making two cars overtake each other without impacting each other; and avoiding both static and non-stationary objects, using the Foxglove simulator.

## Introduction & Environment 
The developed work is embedded in the open-source platform MuSHR, from which we make use of its virtual machine and a docker container that contains all the necessary configurations to start the sensors of the car as ROS packages, as well as to establish all the parameters to start the simulator.

Among the most important ROS packages, is mushr_sim which, once executed, makes it possible to simulate a virtual environment in which to test the car. In addition, this package offers the possibility to control the vehicle via keyboard teleoperation or via algorithms.

### Install 
A tutorial on how to install the environment, required for this project, can be found [here](https://mushr.io/tutorials/noetic_quickstart/).
